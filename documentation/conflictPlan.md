#Bazaar 401 conflict resolution plan

Each member agrees in the need for a comfortable and safe working environment. Being able to successfully resolve conflicts is an important life skill and every conflict is an opportunity to practice these skills. Each member will help write this document and agree it.

Stage 1:<br>
Informally, I will work to resolve conflicts through direct communication. This could be one-on-one conversations in a formal or informal place and time or involving other group members if desired.<br>

I will work to talk with respect and listen with empathy and try to understand the viewpoint of the other person.<br>

I will keep in mind the best practices laid out in the communication plan.<br>

Stage 2:<br>
If informal communication does not work, anyone may raise a formal conflict resolution request. The whole team should at this time be notified of the conflict and a meeting should be called in writing if desired. The point of this is to help bring more attention to the problem and engage the additional problem solving skills of other group members. It can also help to encourage one-on-one resolution rather than going through a formal process.<br>

I will attempt direct communication before raising a formal conflict resolution request.<br>

If the direct communication step is skipped it should be noted why in the formal request. When a formal conflict resolution request is raised I (all group members) will acknowledge that I have received it, and will actively engage as needed to help resolve the conflict.<br>

For formal conflicts, I agree to ensure that a plan of action is agreed to in order to help resolve the problem.<br>

If the problem persists, I can re-raise formal conflict resolution requests or engage in direct communication as necessary. <br>

Stage 3:<br>
If direct communication and formal requests do not work, or are evidently clear to not be a good solution to the problem, anyone can seek outside help from the Code Fellows staff.<br>

I helped create and/or I agree to this plan and will follow it to the best of my ability:<br>
